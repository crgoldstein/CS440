# # Assignment 1: Uninformed Search

# Claire Goldstein
# 
# 

# ## Overview

# Breadth-first and depth-first are two algorithms for performing
# uninformed search---a search that does not use
# knowledge about the goal of the search.  You will implement both
# search algorithms in python and test them on a simple graph.

# ## Required Code

# In this jupyter notebook, you must implement at least the following functions:
# 
#   * `breadthFirstSearch(startState, goalState, successorsf)` 
#   * `depthFirstSearch(startState, goalState, successorsf)`
#   
# Each receives as arguments the starting state, the goal state, and a successors function.  `breadthFirstSearch` returns the breadth-first solution path as a list of states starting with the `startState` and ending with the `goalState`.  `depthFirstSearch` returns the depth-first solution path.
# 
# The search algorithm has been implemented by the specifications in [03 Problem-Solving Agents](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/www.cs.colostate.edu/~anderson/cs440/notebooks/03 Problem-Solving Agents.ipynb) lecture notes.

# # Example

# Here is a simple example.  States are defined by lower case letters.  A dictionary stores a list of successor states for each state in the graph that has successors.

# In[230]:


successors = {'a':  ['b', 'c', 'd'],
              'b':  ['e', 'f', 'g'],
              'c':  ['a','h', 'i'],
              'd':  ['j', 'z'],
              'e':  ['k', 'l'],
              'g':  ['m'],
              'k':  ['z']}
successors


# In[231]:


successors.get('a',[])


# In[232]:


import copy

def successorsf(state):
    return copy.copy(successors.get(state, []))


# In[233]:


successorsf('e')

# 
# Here is an algorithm definition for both breadth-first and depth-first
# search, tailored to fit the python implementation you must complete
# for [Assignment 1](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/www.cs.colostate.edu/~anderson/cs440/notebooks/A1 Uninformed Search.ipynb).  The
# algorithm maintains a local variable named `unExpanded` to be a list
# of nodes whose children have not yet been generated (like the authors'
# `frontier` variable), and a dictionary named `expanded` to keep
# the nodes for which we have generated the children (like the authors'
# `explored` variable).  In each a node is stored with its parent,
# allowing a solution path to be generated be stepping backwards from
# the goal node once it is found.
# 
# Given the `startState`, `goalState`, `successorsf`, and
# `breadthFirst` (a boolean variable):
#   * Initialize `expanded` to be an empty dictionary
#   * Initialize `unExpanded` to be a list containing the pair `(startState, None)`
#   * If `startState` is the `goalState`, return the list containing just `startState`
#   * Repeat the following steps while `unExpanded` is not empty:
#     * Pop from the end of `unExpanded` a (`state`, `parent`) pair.
#     * Generate the `children` of `state` using the `successorsf` function.
#     * Add `state: parent` to the `expanded` dictionary
#     * For efficiency, remove from `children` any states that are already  in `expanded` or `unExpanded`.
#     * If the goal has been found (in python, `goalState` is in `children`):
#       * Initialize the solution path with the list `[state, goalState]`. 
#       * While `parent` exists:
#         * Insert `parent` to the front of the solution path.
#         * Set `parent` to the parent of `parent`.
#       * Return the solution path.
#     * <font color="green">Sort and reverse the list of states in `children`, so that we all find the same solution paths.</font>
#     * Create a modified `children` list by changing each entry to be a pair (child, `parent`), where `parent` is the parent of the child.
#     * Insert the modified `children` list into the `unExpanded` list at the <font color="blue">front if doing breadth-first search , or at the back if doing depth-first search.</font>  Use the boolean variable `breadthFirst` provided as the last argument in the call to this function to control inserting at the front the back.  <font color="red">Do this insertion with one statement, not a for loop</font>, to preserve the order of the children.

# ## Grading
# 
# Your notebook will be run and graded automatically. Download [A1grader.tar](http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~anderson/cs440/notebooks/A1grader.tar) and extract A1grader.py from it. Run the code in the following cell to demonstrate an example grading session. You should see a perfect score of 80/100 if your functions are defined correctly. 
# 
# The remaining 20% will be based on your writing.  In markdown cells, explain what your functions are doing and summarize the algorithms.
# 
# Add at least one markdown cell that describes problems you encountered in trying to solve this assignment.

# ## Check-in

# Do not include this section in your notebook.
# 
# Name your notebook ```Lastname-A1.ipynb```.  So, for me it would be ```Anderson-A1.ipynb```.  Submit the file using the ```Assignment 1``` link on [Canvas](https://colostate.instructure.com/courses/55296).
# 
# Grading will be based on 
# 
#   * correct behavior of the required functions, and
#   * readability of the notebook.
